# [BookEZ](https://bookez.vercel.app/)

This repository serves as the deployment space for BookEZ, a collaborative effort by our team dedicated to creating a seamless salon booking management experience. The code in this repository represents the frontend component of our project. Initially developed on Vercel, we transitioned to our own hosting due to changes in the platform's pricing for organizations.
