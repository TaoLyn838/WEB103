## Notes

The project is both enjoyable and useful for learning backend development, though the starter code makes it significantly more difficult than expected. The issues aren't limited to mismatches with the project instructions; there are many problems within the files, such as an incorrect import path for `Event.jsx`, and both the `client` and `server` sharing a single `package.json` for dependencies, etc.
