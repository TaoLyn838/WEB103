      'A Saurian Hunter from the Scions of the Canopy with the Ancient Name "Malipo", Kinich is a taciturn individual who has a knack for calculating the price of any request — even wetwork — due to his utilitarian philosophy. He is almost always seen with the egocentric self-proclaimed "Almighty Dragonlord" K\'uhul Ajaw, whom he regularly quarrels with.',
    detail:
      'Natlan is a nation where humans and Saurians live side-by-side, and this mutualism has lasted for many years. Such relationships are for the most part friendly, with humans and Saurians as bosom companions. But this does not mean that all Saurians approach humans with friendly intent. Even today, quite a few deaths still occur due to Saurian attacks. This is why Saurian Hunters — of which Kinich happens to be a leading member — exist, deeply familiar with the weaknesses of Saurians as they are. He is of no great age, nor has he been trained by any great master, but through many years of living out in the wild, he has learned the techniques by which he subdues wild beasts and wicked Saurians alike. Like a natural born hunter, he is steady, direct, and efficient, watching his prey with a gaze as sharp as a boning knife. But unlike other Saurian Hunters, Kinich is far from limited by this profession. Rumor has it that for the right price, he will also prove himself to be adept at wet work. It is because of this that many in the tribe keep a distance from him — though of course, some also do so on account of his realistic, utilitarian approach to life. Regardless of whom he receives his commission from, even if they\'re a person in a bind, or still a child, he will always request the remuneration he deems suitable. Nothing can change this belief of his — that all things come at a cost. Such actions provoke confusion, but Kinich has no intention of explaining himself. If you must have an explanation, you can get one, but only after he sticks out an open palm and asks: "And what price are you willing to pay for that?"',

      'Bearing the Ancient Name of "Uthabiti", Kachina is a young warrior belonging to the Children of Echoes who is determined to become strong in spite of the numerous failures she has experienced.',
    detail:
      'Just like the other progeny of the Children of Echoes, Kachina grew up surrounded by adorable Tepetlisaurs, spending her time digging shiny gems out of the bowels of the mountains and listening to her elders passing down the legends of heroes. She learned the mountain paths like the back of her hand, developing a great instinct and talent for finding minerals buried deep beneath the ground. When she had some time to kill, she\'d be with all the other kids, running off to the music studios where artists were recording their newest tunes to just cut loose and dance freely to the pulsing rhythms. Growing up in this environment, the occasional bump and scratch was unavoidable, and Kachina would cry out in pain when she hurt herself, just like any other child. But long before any other kid would have recovered, Kachina would have wiped away her tears and stood back up again. In the eyes of others, of course she was a good kid. But Kachina still struggled to understand why someone as ordinary as herself was given the Ancient Name "Uthabiti." Just what part of her was worthy of the ideals of strength this great name carried? Young as she was, she was unable to puzzle it out. But having been granted this great honor, she had an obligation to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Moreover, returning triumphantly from the Pilgrimage and rising up like the heroes of legend was the dream of every warrior of Natlan — including Kachina. As she experienced failure time and time again, not only was she overwhelmed with sadness, but she couldn\'t even lift her head to face the disappointed looks in the faces of her friends. Nevertheless, she would wipe away her tears, and stand up once more. But having already failed so many times, could she really achieve success in the Pilgrimage? Kachina, who always gave everything she had, to fight on, felt doubt creeping into her heart.',

    description: `An independent designer hailing from Inazuma who strives to make her brand internationally recognized across all of Teyvat, Chiori is the industrious yet headstrong owner of Chioriya Boutique, a fashion label in Fontaine which has also served as an "intelligence boutique" for law enforcement. Steadfast in attaining what she wants, she refuses to change her ways and personality to conform with societal norms.`,
    detail: `You push open the doors to the boutique. Situated on one of Fontaine's busiest thoroughfares, it is named for its designer.
The crisp ringing of a bell chimes from above as if wishing luck to all customers who step through the door. If the rumors swirling about have even a grain of truth to them, then perhaps such blessings will come in handy.
"Welcome to the Chioriya Boutique, how may I help you?" The greeting that reaches your ears, while perhaps lacking somewhat in enthusiasm, is filled with assurance.
The owner of the voice shoots you a glance from behind the counter. A striking foreigner with captivating eyes — just like they said.
"A personalized, custom job? Or something off the shelf?" Her second question. The tone fills you with a certain feeling — as though the second someone steps through the door, even the highest-ranking aristocrat becomes merely a guest in her kingdom, while she sits high upon her throne, allowing supplicants to choose from among the blessings she offers.
"I'd like tailor-made formal attire." You say. Her expression softens a little. It appears that in this kingdom, customizing the cut of the cloth to the customer and designing a personalized outfit in the Kingdom's name is something worth a smile.
Perhaps this is the best possible outcome, you muse to yourself. After all, those who recommended the shop to you not only all praised the exquisite handiwork of this designer, but some nearly couldn't stop themselves from opening wide their wardrobes to show off the dazzling contents within, as though they wished nothing more than to shove you inside to bask in the clothes' glory for a day. They even say that the owner of the shop is rarely found within, and if she is on the premises, that means she is in a good mood.
But you quietly swallow all the same, for you know when fortune does not hold you in her fickle favor, then all manner of unimaginable and outrageous things may occur when the owner is in, such as...
Before you can even get a handle on your thoughts and feelings, the bell above the door screams a metallic protest. The boutique's door has been kicked wide open by a man swaying and rocking, foul breath reeking of alcohol and language yet more foul spilling out of his mouth.
"I—I won! I won the bet, the Boss is in toda—" Though you could not clearly see just what happened, before he even finished speaking, he suddenly flew out the window, drawing an elegant arc through the air.
Chiori brushes her hands and closes the window, before saying to you, as if nothing had happened, "Apologies, the weather has been somewhat inclement of late. All kinds of trash have come blowing into my shop. It's been taken care of, so pay it no heed."
It appears this kingdom does not welcome all unconditionally.`,

    detail: `The "Liyue Qixing" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.
The "Tianquan" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. 
She is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.
Still, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.`,
